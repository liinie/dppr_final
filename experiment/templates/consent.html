                        This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Lin Xu
                        from the Max Planck Research Group for Rationality Enhancement
                        at the MPI for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen.

                    <p>
                        This study investigates when people are more motivated to learn a
                        new valuable skill and how to motivate them.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If you decide to participate in this study we will ask you to play a game using keyboard for
                        about 3 minutes.
                        After you submit the HIT, you will get a monetary reward of 0.5 Euro and a bonus proportionally
                        to your performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation in this research is voluntary.

                    <p>
                        Participating in this study will help find out if the value of learning certain skills towards
                        a certain goal could be conveyed so that it could help people make better decisions.
                        We hope that this research will benefit society at large by laying the scientific basis for
                        developing more effective productivity software.
